# Example App

This guide walks you through the Example app implementation showcasing how 100ms SDK can be utilized to build delightful apps.ü§©

For the SDK integration guide, checkout the [ReadMe here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk/).

üì≤ Download this 100ms fully featured Sample iOS app here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/dhUSE7N8

## ‚òùÔ∏è Pre-requistes
- Xcode 12 or higher
- Support for iOS 10 or higher
- Complete the 5 steps of [Setup Process as listed here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk#-setup-guide) to get Access Keys & Tokens 

## üèé Run the application
1. Put in your Token Endpoint at Code completion mark in `Constants.swift` file Line 15. 

    The `Constants` file is located at path `Example/HMSSDKExample/SupportingFiles/Constants.swift` 

    Make sure it ends with a backslash (/)

    For example:
    ```
    static let tokenEndpoint = "https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/<your-subdomain>/"  # ‚úÖ Valid
    static let tokenEndpoint = "https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/<your-subdomain>"   # ‚ùå invalid
    ```
2. Ensure that [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is installed on your Mac.
3. In the Example folder, run `pod install` to install dependencies of the Example app.
4. Open the `HMSSDKExample.xcworkspace` file & Build & Run the `HMSSDKExample` target on Simulator.
5. To run the Example app on your device, you'll need to add your Apple Developer Team in Signing & Capabilites tab of Xcode.
6. Change the bundle id (live.100ms.videoapp) and app group name (group.live.100ms.videoapp) to something unique when running this example in Xcode. Once done, find the app group name string including quotes ("group.live.100ms.videoapp") in the project and replace it with your new group name (for example "group.company.appname").

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è App User Walkthrough

#### Login Screen
- For the first run of the app, you'll be prompted for permission to access Camera & Microphone.

- In the Login Screen of the app, Enter your Meeting RoomID & click on Join Meeting.

- You'll be prompted to Enter your Name. Type in the name you want to use in the Meeting Room. 

Note: Please note that we use 'host' as default role name in this example app. If you have different role, replace the default 'host' role with your custom role in RoomService.swift:

```
createRequest(for url: String, _ user: String, _ room: String) -> URLRequest?
...

var body = [  "room_id": room,
              "user_id": user,
              "role": "host"]

```

## üìÅ Files of importance 
- [HMSSDKInteractor](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk/blob/main/Example/HMSSDKExample/Meeting/HMSSDKInteractor.swift): Interacts with HMSSDK & conforms to the HMSUpdateListener protocol to listen for updates like Peer Join/Leave, Track Mute/Unmute, etc coming in from the SDK.
- [MeetingViewModel](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk/blob/main/Example/HMSSDKExample/Meeting/MeetingViewModel.swift): Controls the View layout & conforms to `HMSDataSourceDelegate` protocol through which it populates Video Tracks on UI.
- [RoomService](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk/blob/main/Example/HMSSDKExample/Meeting/RoomService.swift): Implements logic to fetch [Client Side Token](https://docs.100ms.live/v2/server-side/Generate-client-side-token) & pass it on `HMSSDKInteractor` while joining a room.

## ü§© View Modes

The Sample app has various View Modes which change the layout of the Meeting. Clicking the Change Meeting Layout button on the top right of the screen shows the following Mode options -
